Printer Simulation Data

Printer Setup [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - what the labs are like now
Average number of floors traveled = 24.2236
Number of trials to get this number = 10000

Best Simulated Printer Setup [1.0, 5.0, 8.0, 9.0, 12.0, 13.0, 16.0, 33.0]
Average number of floors traveled = 14.7636
Number of trials to get this number = 10000 

Worst Simulated Printer Setup [38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38]
Average number of floors traveled = 81.0161
Number of trials to get this number = 10000


Printers are generated via a uniform distribution from -2 to 38, -2 being
outside the building, -1 being the cathedral basement

Since the number of combinations for 38C8 is 48903492, it was not feasible
due to time and processor constraints to brute force the best answer.
As such, the method done to get this result was to make two lists,
append every list of printer setups to one, append the average floors
traveled to the other, then find the index of the minimum average traveled
floors and the associated setup in the other list. It does not appear possible
to have a setup where the average floors traveled is smaller than 14. Most
range from 15 to 17. 

Ultimately we can conclude that the printer setup in the cathedral is 
not optimal under any circumstances, and could stand to have some printers
moved to other floors.

Desk Simulation Data
Number of desk attendants on duty: 4
Total number of visits in a day: 8.6953
Minutes the lab is open: 870
Minutes utilized: 17.395022556286616
Max utilization (minutes/total minutes for all workers) = 0.004998
Number of trials to get this number = 10000

From the collected data it was established that the help desk was used at a
rate of 0.6 people per hour, and an assumed average  duration of that desk
use was 2 minutes. The labs are open from 7:30 am to 10 pm on monday through
Thursday and there are 4 attendants on duty. The help desk utilization is less 
than one percent, and thus 4 people for the two labs are unneeded.

Computer Usage Simulation Data

Average of max concurrent users per day: 32.461
Total number of lab computers: 67
Computer utilization = 32.461/67 = .48449
number of trials to get this number = 1000

From our data collection, it was established that for our sample, students come
into the labs to use the computers at an average rate of 0.52 people per 60 minutes.
This simulation was difficult to quantify so some assumptions were made based on what 
was known. In general, people are using a lab computer for one of three reasons. 
Printing something out, to waste time between classes, or to work on a bigger project.
Printing something takes under 2 minutes usually, wasting time lasts on average of 
40 minutes or so, and project people tend to stay for over an hour. Assuming that
the midrange of people are most common, this was thought to follow a normal distribution.
The simulation resulted in an average server utilization of less than half, and thus 
it was concluded that under these conditions, pitt could stand to remove several computers
from the lab.


Operating System Bias Simulation Data

Number of PCs: 44
Number of macs: 21
Average total users of PCs per day: 341.579
Average total users of macs per day: 110.156
Average of max concurrent users of macs per day: 11.014
Average of max concurrent users of PCs per day: 25.786
PC Utilization = 25.786/44 = 0.586
Mac Utilization = 11.014/21 = 0.524
number of trials it took to get this number = 1000

The PC and Mac Utilization at pitt are fairly even with respect to how many
of each the computer labs have, such that the operating system distribution
of the labs is fine and does not need to be changed. However, this simulation
also supports the general computer usage data, in that utilization for individual
operating systems being around 50% lines up well with the overal computer utilization
also being around 50%, and as such this simulation also supports cutting down on 
the overall number of computers. It further shows that the thinning of computer 
systems in the cathedral labs should be done in a way that is proportional to the 
operating system.
